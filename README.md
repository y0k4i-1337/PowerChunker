# PowerChunker

PowerChunker is tool designed to Bypass AMSI via PowerShell by splitting a file into multiple chunks. In a [post on my blog](https://icyguider.github.io/2021/07/21/Bypass-AMSI-via-PowerShell-with-Zero-Effort.html), I discuss how malicious powershell scripts can evade detection by AMSI if they're run line-by-line, or in chunks. I've included [Rasta-mouse's AmsiScanBuffer patch](https://rastamouse.me/memory-patching-amsi-bypass/) as a PoC to demonstrate how PowerChunker can automate this process to make a detected bypass execute without the need for obfuscation.

PowerChunker.py has no dependencies other than python3. The `-s,--serve` flag can be provided if the user wants to host the attack from the current server. Otherwise, all .ps1 files that are generated by this script must be transfered over to the web server that will serve them.
```
usage: PowerChunker.py [-h] [-d DIR] [-s] [-o stager.ps1] [-b bypass.ps1] [-r] [-t TIMEOUT] file host

  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Directory to write results to (Optional)
  -s, --serve           Start HTTP Server to host stager (Optional)
  -o stager.ps1, --out stager.ps1
                        Name of final stager (Optional)
  -b bypass.ps1, --bypass bypass.ps1
                        Prepend bypass code from file (Optional)
  -r, --random          Randomize output filenames (except final stager)
